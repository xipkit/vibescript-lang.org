{"title": "Tooling views", "type": "reference", "description": "Tooling views for the Rust implementation of Vibescript.", "source": "docs/tooling.md", "guide": true}

`vibescript::tooling` gives editors and command-line tools read-only views of source: its declarations and statements, the statements that can never run, and the language's reserved words and member tables. The `vibes lsp` language server, `vibes run`, `vibes test` and `vibes analyze` are built on it. Nothing here compiles, checks or runs code. `Script::source()` returns a compiled script's text, so a tool that has already compiled a script can inspect it without keeping the text itself.

```rust
use vibescript::tooling::{ItemKind, member_receiver, outline};

let source = "class Wallet\n  def balance(currency: string) -> int\n    total = 0\n    total\n  end\nend\n";
let outline = outline(source)?;
let wallet = &outline.items[0];
assert_eq!((wallet.kind, wallet.name.as_str()), (ItemKind::Class, "Wallet"));
let balance = &wallet.children[0];
assert_eq!((balance.kind, balance.position.line), (ItemKind::Method, 2));
let function = balance.function.as_ref().unwrap();
assert_eq!(function.params[0].type_annotation.as_deref(), Some("string"));
assert_eq!(function.locals, ["total"]);

let probe = "def f(s: string)\n  s.probe\nend\n";
assert_eq!(member_receiver(probe, "probe"), Some("string"));
# Ok::<(), vibescript::Error>(())
```

## Declaration outlines

`outline(source)` parses one source and returns its top-level items in source order: functions, aliases, classes, modules, enums and plain statements. Each statement reports its syntactic kind, such as an assignment, an `if` or a `begin` block, so a tool can tell whether top-level code executes anything, as `vibes run` and `vibes test` do. Classes and modules list their instance methods, `def self.` methods, property declarations, aliases, module constants, nested modules and body statements; enums list their members. Each item has a one-based line and Unicode character column, like the positions in compile diagnostics. A declaration's position is its first keyword or modifier, so `private def secret` starts at `private`; enum members and properties start at their names.

Functions, methods and aliases carry signature and body facts; `Function::requires_arguments()` reports whether a call must supply an argument. Parameters report their kind, their annotation in the canonical form used by type errors, whether they have a default and whether they assign an instance variable. Bodies report the local names they assign outside blocks, their named rescue clauses and where their last statement begins. These facts describe the syntax only. They are not scopes: a name assigned in one branch is listed even when another path never assigns it.

Outlining uses the compiler's parser with the same source-size and syntax-depth guards, and a source that does not parse returns the same error as `Engine::compile`. It does not validate what compilation would reject after parsing. The walk keeps its own stack, so deeply nested source does not exhaust the native stack.

## Unreachable statements

`unreachable(source)` reports every statement that can never run because an earlier statement in the same body always leaves it: a `return`, `raise`, `break`, `next` or `retry`, or a compound statement whose every path ends in one, such as an `if` whose branches all return. A scope is a function name, `<script>`, `Class#method`, `Class.method` or `Class.<class body>`, and each enclosing block appends ` block at LINE:COLUMN`. Positions inside a string interpolation count from the interpolation's first non-space character.

```rust
let found = vibescript::tooling::unreachable("def run\n  [1].each { |x|\n    raise \"boom\"\n    x\n  }\nend\n")?;
assert_eq!(found[0].function, "run block at 2:12");
assert_eq!((found[0].position.line, found[0].position.column), (4, 5));
# Ok::<(), vibescript::Error>(())
```

## Member receivers

`member_receiver(source, name)` classifies the receiver of the first member access called `name`. An editor that wants completions after `value.` can splice a name no script uses at the cursor, so an incomplete line still parses as a member access, and ask for the receiver kind. Literals decide their kind, and so does a parameter of the enclosing function annotated with one non-nullable builtin type. Locals, calls, nullable and union annotations, named types and accesses inside string interpolation report `None`. A syntax error after the access does not matter; one before it does.

## Tokens

`tokens(source)` lists the tokens the parser read, with their byte spans, after its own re-reading of a `/` or `%` as a regex or percent literal. Whitespace and comments fall between tokens, so a tool that edits token spans keeps them. A string with interpolation reports the span of each interpolation, whose content tokenizes as source of its own.

## Builtin catalogs

`keywords()` lists the reserved words, and `identifier_char` and `uppercase` classify characters by the same Unicode tables as the lexer. `member_names()` lists the builtin member names per receiver kind in the order used for suggestions, followed by the universal helpers each kind answers. The global builtins come from [`vibescript::builtins()`](/reference/sessions/#builtin-names).

`Script::declarations()` also lists top-level declarations, with the byte span of each, for a script that compiled; an interactive session uses the spans to carry declarations into later input. `outline` differs in what it covers: it needs only a parse, and it describes members, signatures, bodies and statements, which an editor needs while a document is being written.
